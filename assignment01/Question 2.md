2. Why use two’s complement to represent negative numbers?  

Using two’s complement to represent negative numbers makes it possible to accurately add positive and negative numbers using binary addition. Furthermore, it allows the same binary adder logic to be used for both unsigned and signed operations and no separate instructions are needed for signed and unsigned additon/subtraction.
