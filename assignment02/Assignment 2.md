1.
A) 0x20000000 <br>
B) 0x20000000 <br>
C) No flags were set in the APSR. This is because the result is not negative, is not a zero, does not has a carry, does not cause an overflow, saturation has not occurred, and no Greater than or Equal flags were set. <br>

2.
A) 0 <br>
B) The zero and carry flags are set. This is because this add operation resulted with a carry bit and the result is 0. <br>

3.
A) 0x20000000 <br>
B) No flags were set in the APSR. This is because the result is not negative, is not a zero, does not has a carry, does not cause an overflow, saturation has not occurred, and no Greater than or Equal flags were set. <br>

4.
A) 0 <br>
B) The zero and carry flags are set. This is because this add operation resulted with a carry bit and the result is 0. <br>

5.
A) By moving the counter variable outside of main function it becomes a global variable <br>
B) No, counter variable is no longer visible in “Locals” view <br>
C) I use “Auto” view to track counter variable <br>
D) The address of counter variable in memory is 0x20000000 <br>

6.
A) 4 <br>
B) The counter value has changed to 4 because: <br>
    i.The p_int pointer is pointing to the address of counter and pointer value is incremented three times <br>
   ii.The counter variable is incremented once <br>

7.
A) The address of counter variable in memory is 0x20000000 <br>
B) The counter variable is stored in RAM <br>
C) 4 <br>
