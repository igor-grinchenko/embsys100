A)0x20000000
B)0x20000000
C)No flags were set in the APSR. This is because the result is not negative, is not a zero, does not has a carry, does not 	cause an overflow, saturation has not occurred, and no Greater than or Equal flags were set.

2.
A)0
B)The zero and carry flags are set. This is because this add operation resulted with a carry bit and the result is 0.
