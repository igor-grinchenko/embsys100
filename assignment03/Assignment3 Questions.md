A) Morse code is a character encoding scheme that encodes text characters using two different signal durations called dots and dashes. The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement and dash is three times the duration of a dot. Morse code primarily consists of 26 English letters A through Z and Arabic numerals. Morse code can be transmitted by information carrying medium such as visible light, radio waves, sound waves, and electric current.

B) Morse code was originally developed by Samuel Morse for electrical telegraphy. It was later improved and standardized by a conference of European nations in 1851.
