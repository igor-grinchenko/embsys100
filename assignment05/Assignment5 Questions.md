A) First the compiler pushed registers R3-R7 and LR onto CSTACK. Second, the compiler loaded variable x and y values from memory and stored them on CSTACK. Third, the compiler stored the address of variables on CSTACK to the CSTACK which are the pointers xPtr and yPtr. Lastly, compiler saved pointer xPtr and yPtr addresses on CSTACK to registers R0 and R1.

B) The values stored in R0 and R1 are the CSTACK address of pointers xPtr and yPtr.
